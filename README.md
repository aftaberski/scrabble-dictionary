# Scrabble Dictionary Search
As part of a pairing workshop at Recurse Center, @danluu and I wrote some bash scripts to search a scrabble dictionary text file:

- [x] what words contain "UU"? What words contain "Q" without "U"?
- [x] what letters, if any, never appear doubled? (by that I mean — "AA" appears doubled because it is in "AARDVARK", "BB" appears doubled because it is in “BUBBLE" — are there any letters that never appear doubled in a word?)
- [ ] what is the longest palindrome?
- [ ] what words contain all of the vowels and Y, in alphabetical order?
- [ ] what words contain all of the vowels and Y, in any order?
- [ ] what letter makes the most appearances in a single word, and what is that word?
- [ ] what words are the longest anagrams of each other? (single words, no phrases)
